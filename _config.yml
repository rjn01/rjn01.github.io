about_content: | 
  I am a driven Master's student at Freie Universit√§t Berlin, specializing in Data Science. With a strong background as a Senior Software Engineer, I am dedicated to leveraging technology to enhance efficiency and improve customer experiences.
  In my previous role, I played a pivotal part in implementing the Retail Loan Origination System (RLOS) for a bank, where I optimized loan processes and led cross-functional teams to deliver impactful projects on time. My proficiency in Java, Python, and SQL, along with hands-on experience in machine learning and web development, has equipped me with a diverse skill set to tackle complex challenges effectively.
